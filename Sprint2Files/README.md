This contains the source code for the web pages and backend php functions that were
developed for Sprint 2. Also the file tatV1_4.sql contains the database schema for
the MySQL database as it existed at that point in time.
 
These files and the MySQL database were uploaded to Amazon to demonstrate to the team
and can be viewed at http://ec2-54-186-29-162.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/CPT331/
