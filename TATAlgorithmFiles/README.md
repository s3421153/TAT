This contains the source code for the backend php functions that were developed for the
core team algorithm as described in the Detailed Algorithm document. Also the
file tatalgorithm.sql is an export file of the MySQL database schema and test data used
while coding/testing.
 
The actual algorithm code is contained in a single file called teamAlgorithm.php and the
function to call is teamAlgorithm($CourseID, $SubjectID)

However to help testing and debugging, some additional code was created that provides a
minimal front end to call the algorithm function and display debug data.These files and
the MySQL database were uploaded to Amazon while testing/coding the algorithm and can
be viewed at http://ec2-54-186-29-162.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/tatalgorithm/
